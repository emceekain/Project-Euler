# Problem 9 - Special Pythagorean triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, $a < b < c$, for which,
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

For example, $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which $a + b + c = 1000$.
Find the product abc.

## Solution:
First of all elementary algebra shows that allows us to solve conclude $$b=\frac{1000(500-a)}{1000-a}.$$ The obvious bound on a is $1<a<1000$, however, upon closer inspection, we see that $1<a<500$
